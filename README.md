### Hugo Trentesaux [https://trentesaux.fr](https://trentesaux.fr)

I am Hugo Trentesaux, PhD in physics. I think that code used in the context of science must be published since it's part of the scientific approach. I think that code written in the context of public research must lie under a public license as soon as part of the funding is public. I think the principles of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) should be applied to science as well.

This is my page on GitHub, a proprietary service owned by Microsoft. I use it mainly to contribute to projects which are hosted there. You can find my other main public repos at the following addresses :

- https://git.42l.fr/HugoTrentesaux (personal one)
- https://git.duniter.org/HugoTrentesaux (Duniter project)
- https://gitlab.com/Hugo-Trentesaux (old one)
- https://framagit.org/HugoTrentesaux (at Framasoft)

### Techs

I am self-taught in computer science (in the spirit of [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)). I like contributing to other's projects and programming small proofs-of-concept when I have an idea. My favourite languages are:

- Julia
- Rust
- Python

I'm familiar with these langages:

- HTML/CSS/JS
- C
- C#
- Dart

I'm familiar with these softwares / frameworks / tools ...:

- GNU/Linux
- VSCodium
- Git (you guessed it)
- VueJS
- Flutter
- Django
- SQL
- Blender
- Inkscape
- GIMP

I hate:

- Matlab (even I'm good at it)
- LabView (some people consider it a langage)
- Windows (except WSL which is fine even it suffers from running on ntfs) / OSX

### Projects

Here you can find a list of some of my least prototypical projects (but still):

- https://github.com/LaboJeanPerrin/easyRLS (closed source !) analysis pipeline in Matlab unfortunately coded on a table corner
